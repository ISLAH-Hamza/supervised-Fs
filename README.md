# supervised-Fs

This repository contains my implementation of the selection algorithms treated in my end of study project titled: **Supervised feature selection based on association and redundancy**.

This repository will be organized as follows:

- the data sets folder contains the real and simulated data sets used to test the algorithms
- the one-labels folder contains the selection algorithms that process the target variable when it contains only one label
- the multi-labels folder will contain the FMFS algorithm, which works on data array with several labels.
- finally the test folder which contains the description of the tests used and the results obtained.
